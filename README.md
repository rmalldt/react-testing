# Testing React Apps

This is a React app built with the following technologies and libraries:

- Auth0
- Tailwind
- RadixUI
- React Router
- React Query
- Redux Toolkit

## Setting up Auth0 for Authentication

1. **Sign up for an Auth0 Account:**

   If you don't already have an Auth0 account, you can sign up for one at [https://auth0.com/](https://auth0.com/). Auth0 offers a free tier that you can use for your project.

2. **Create a New Application:**

   - Log in to your Auth0 account.
   - Go to the Auth0 Dashboard.
   - Click on "Applications" in the left sidebar.
   - Click the "Create Application" button.
   - Give your application a name (e.g., "My React App").
   - Select "Single Page Web Applications" as the application type.

3. **Configure Application Settings:**

   - On the application settings page, configure the following settings:
     - Allowed Callback URLs: `http://localhost:5173`
     - Allowed Logout URLs: `http://localhost:5173`
     - Allowed Web Origins: `http://localhost:5173`
   - Save the changes.

4. **Obtain Auth0 Domain and ClientID:**

   - On the application settings page, you will find your Auth0 Domain and Client ID near the top of the page.
   - Copy the Auth0 Domain (e.g., `your-auth0-domain.auth0.com`) and Client ID (e.g., `your-client-id`).

5. **Create a `.env.local` File:**

   - In the root directory of the project, you'll find a sample `.env` file. Make a copy and save it as `.env.local`.
   - Replace the Auth0 Domain and Client ID with the actual values you obtained from Auth0.

## Running the App

Now that you have set up Auth0 and configured your environment variables, you can run the React app using the following commands:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm start
```
